# Homework 4 

We can decide who to target based on the graph analysis and centrality scores in the following ways:

Target the Largest Community: We may be able to reach a huge number of clients and maximize our marketing efforts by focusing on this neighborhood. This group could comprise devoted clients or influential people who could act as brand ambassadors for our telecom services.
Identify the influencers with the highest degree of centrality within the top three communities as your target influencers. These influencers are more likely to spread the word about our telecom services among their connections. We may use their influence to reach a larger audience by focusing on them.
Take High Eigenvector Centrality Nodes as an example: Targeting nodes with high eigenvector centrality may be advantageous even while the eigenvector centrality computation experienced convergence problems. These nodes can serve as bridges to join various communities because they are connected to other nodes with enormous influence. We may be able to reach various customer demographics and widen our customer base by focusing on them.
We can designate a percentage of our marketing budget to reach out to the target groups after identifying them:
Targeting the largest community should receive a large amount of the marketing budget. This can encompass a range of marketing strategies like targeted email marketing, social media campaigns, and internet advertising.
Spend a percentage of the marketing budget working together with the top three communities' identified influencers. To use their influence and engage with their contacts, this can involve collaboration programs, referral rewards, or influencer marketing techniques.
Spend less money on marketing and, if possible, consider focusing on nodes with high eigenvector centrality. To reach these powerful nodes, this may include using customised marketing campaigns or targeted advertising.
By keeping track of key performance indicators (KPIs) including customer acquisition, conversion rates, and customer feedback, marketing initiatives may be evaluated for their efficacy. Based on the outcomes, ongoing graph analysis, and centrality metrics, modify the marketing plans and budget allocation.
By putting this action plan into action, the telecom firm will be able to strategically use its marketing budget to target the most influential people and groups, maximizing the effect of its marketing initiatives and maybe growing its client base.
